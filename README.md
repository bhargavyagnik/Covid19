# Covid19
 A fully functional Covid 19 Flask application with stats and Predictions
It takes data from api.covid19india.org as well as the international data.

I have used Pygal for the Data Visualisations .

It uses Pygal for Data visualisations. 
```python
pip install pygal
``` 
Also as I've use maps so you need another pygal extension to get the maps.

The reason to use Pygal was that pygal easily generates the svg files which are very helpful in websites

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.

Ive tried to learn a lot from this project like Adding Google Analytics, Using Flask properly as this stands my first complete end to end live project. Previoulsy ive worked on Flask but it was just for some small AI projects.

Respect to all the Web Developers !
I really created the backend in 2 hours but the frontend was really very tough !!!
